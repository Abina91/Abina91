Hi, I’m Abi
👀 I’m interested in Full-Stack Development, Data Analysis, and Web Development
🌱 I’m currently learning React and building a Recipe Finder App called Cookistry
📊 I’ve also explored Power BI and created an Amazon Prime Dashboard
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Civic Engagement Websites, Full-Stack Projects, and Data Analytics Projects
⚡ Fun fact: I once learned all React basics in just 1 hour to challenge myself — and nailed it!
🍳 Love cooking, coding, or data? You’re officially my kind of people!
